<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>When I was younger, my mother struggled with substances and often neglected me. Video games and some of the other hobbies I will list below were my escapism. 
I had a playstation when I was younger that one of my mothers boyfriends at the time gave to me after they had broke up. Unfortunately, my mother had sold it. It wasn't until almost recently where 
I was able to buy my own gaming conole and get back into gaming again.</p>

<h3>Aragami 2</h3>

<p>I had downloaded this on a whim, thinking I can just play it when I was bored and had time. However, I quickly realized that 
I was so invested in the storyline and the gaming mechanics that I didn't realize I would spend almost two and a half hours playing it.</p>

<h3>Kingdom Hearts</h3>

<p>When I had the PlayStation, I vividly remember playing Kingdom Hearts and instantly falling in love with it. 
Any child would love Disney and it's games, this was no different. Throughout my years, even without a console, I tried to keep up with the franchise. This was one of the first games 
I downloaded once I finally got an Xbox.</p>

<h3>Minecraft</h3>

<p>Other than KH, Minecraft was a game I heard a lot growing up but never really took an interest in it. It wasn't until one of my high school friends introduced me to a 
YouTube Gamer known as Dream that I really understood just the possibilities the game has. When I finally downloaded it and explored what can be done, it instantly became one of my favorites. 
I typically love to explore and build in survival mode.</p>

<P>When I didn't have a gaming console growing up, my mind would build these intricate and complex stories that would almost never end. 
It got to the point where I would write or type these stories down whenever and where ever I could. In my teens years, I actually created a 
small story on a website called Wattpad and it quickly became very popular, placing #30 in it's category. It wasn't until recently where I decied to make another story again.
With the knowledge I've gained from this class, I've been thinking of making a website just for my novel to help both my readers and me. I won't spoil what I have
in store but I would be more than please to talk about it to those who will listen.

<P>Before I had gotten a tablet for my 18th birthday, I was often doing traditional art and even took a few community college classes to help further my artistic
abilities. However, I started to get more in to digital art and soon realized that I enjoy making simple line arts and designs rather than what I was doing before. 
In fact, I even designed my own tribal tattoo that I plan on getting in the furure. My Dad was full Samoan while my mother is partically Mexican and Filipino so tribal tattoos
have always popped up in conversation. However, my Dad's side of the family never liked me and were often very distant, playing nice every now and than. I knew that if I were to ever get
a tribal tattoo, I would have to do the research and creation on my own. So, I am proud to say that after a year of research and playing with different designs, I have created my tribal tattoo. I'm sure I don't have to
point out which one it is.
