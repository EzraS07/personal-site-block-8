    <li> <a href="file:///C:/Users/ezraf/OneDrive/Documents/Course%20Work/Zoo%20Assignment.html">The Zoo</a> </li>
        <p>The Zoo project was one of the first websites we created in class. Here, we learned the basics of html tags such as the heading, regular paraphrasing, and even some
            arrtibutes that can show images and links.
        </p>

    <li> <a href="file:///C:/Users/ezraf/OneDrive/Documents/Course%20Work/SecureTheVault.html">The Vault</a> </li>
        <P>With the vault assignment, we got more into Javascript. We had to create an alert that would pop up when anyone 
            opens the page. The way our instructor explained it was that the html is the skeleton of the website, the css is how the website
            looks, and lastly, Javascript is how the website functions.</P>

    <li> <a href="file:///C:/Users/ezraf/OneDrive/Documents/Course%20Work/Resume.html">My Resume</a> </li>
        <p>In this project, we learned how the typical work process would be when working in web development career and job. In this project
            I was the 'driver' while my partner was the 'navagator'. What this means is that I was typing the coding for the website while my partner was telling 
            me what to put on the website.
